#Predicting Apple Stock Prices using LSTM and Time Series Analysis
##Introduction
This repository contains code and data for predicting the stock price of Apple using Long Short-term memory (LSTM) and traditional time series analysis techniques. The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle, and it covers a period of over 40 years, from 1980 to 2021.

##Dataset
The dataset contains historical stock prices of Apple and financial indicators such as Open, Close, High, Low, Volume, and Adjusted Close. The data was sourced from Yahoo Finance, which is a reputable source of financial information.

##Approach
We plan to use a combination of LSTM and traditional time series analysis techniques such as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Exponential Smoothing (ETS) to make predictions. Additionally, we will use linear regression to identify the most important financial indicators that affect the stock price of Apple.

We will use a rolling window approach to train and test the LSTM model. This approach involves using a subset of the data as training data and the remaining data as testing data. This will allow us to evaluate the model's performance over time and assess its ability to make accurate predictions.

##Code
The code for this project is written in Python and is available in the code directory. The code is organized into different files for preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.

##Results
The results of our analysis will be presented in the form of plots and tables, which will show the performance of the different models and the most important financial indicators that affect the stock price of Apple.

##Conclusion
We believe that this project will provide valuable insights into the stock market and help investors make informed decisions based on data-driven insights. The code and data in this repository are open-source and can be used by anyone interested in predicting stock prices using LSTM and time series analysis techniques.
